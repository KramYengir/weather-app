The purpose of this assignment was to put to practice what I've learned about JS promise and async & await concepts.

Unlike previous projects, I planned the design on Figma before I began. I then wrote the core layout HTML & CSS. 
Then I planned step by step what was needed with my code and I stuck to it. This project was a huge improvement on planning and disclipine for me.

### What I've learned...
- How to make API requests using Fetch
- Working with asynchronous functions and how it affects the flow of my code
- How to retrieve necessary data from request responses (JSON)
- Handling errors in requests
- A better understanding of the modular approach & the single responsibility principle
- How to adapt a 'mobile first' approach
- How to set up and re-use my typical npm/webpack environment
- Resisted using arrow functions everywhere, instead kept it simple with function declarations

### Where I need improvement...
- Not forgetting to commit work regularly and make use of branches
- Still unsure when working with SVGs
- Need to improve the accessibility factor in my works
